Feature: Adhearsion App Generator
  In order to do development on new Adhearsion apps
  As an Adhearsion developer
  I want to generate an Adhearsion app

  Scenario: Generate application with valid layout
    When I run `ahn create path/somewhere`
    And I cd to "path/somewhere"
    Then the following directories should exist:
      | app/call_controllers  |
      | lib                   |
      | config                |
      | script                |
      | spec                  |
      | spec/call_controllers |
      | spec/support          |

    And the following files should exist:
      | .gitignore                                |
      | .rspec                                    |
      | app/call_controllers/simon_game.rb        |
      | config/adhearsion.rb                      |
      | config/environment.rb                     |
      | config/events.rb                          |
      | config/routes.rb                          |
      | Gemfile                                   |
      | script/ahn                                |
      | spec/spec_helper.rb                       |
      | spec/call_controllers/simon_game_spec.rb  |
      | README.md                                 |
      | Rakefile                                  |
      | Procfile                                  |

    And the file "config/adhearsion.rb" should contain each of these content parts:
    """
    Adhearsion.config
    logging.level
    config.punchblock
    """
    And the file "config/events.rb" should contain each of these content parts:
    """

    """
    And the file "config/routes.rb" should contain each of these content parts:
    """
    Adhearsion.router

    """
    And the file "app/call_controllers/simon_game.rb" should contain "class SimonGame"
    And the file "script/ahn" should contain "require 'adhearsion'"
