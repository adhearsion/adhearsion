module Adhearsion
  class CallController
    module Menu

      # Creates and manages a multiple choice menu driven by DTMF, handling playback of prompts,
      # invalid input, retries and timeouts, and final failures.
      #
      # @example A complete example of the method is as follows:
      #   menu "Welcome, ", "/opt/sounds/menu-prompt.mp3", :tries => 2, :timeout => 10 do
      #     match 1, OperatorController
      #
      #     match 10..19 do
      #       pass DirectController
      #     end
      #
      #     match [5, 6, 9] do |exten|
      #       play "The #{exten} extension is currently not active"
      #     end
      #
      #     match '7', OfficeController
      #
      #     invalid { play "Please choose a valid extension" }
      #     timeout { play "Input timed out, try again." }
      #     failure { pass OperatorController }
      #   end
      #
      # The first arguments to #menu will be a list of sounds to play, as accepted by #play, including strings for TTS, Date and Time objects, and file paths.
      # :tries and :timeout options respectively specify the number of tries before going into failure, and the timeout in seconds allowed on each digit input.
      # The most important part is the following block, which specifies how the menu will be constructed and handled.
      #
      # #match handles connecting an input pattern to a payload.
      # The pattern can be an integer, a Range, a string or an Array of the possible single types.
      # Input is matched against patterns, and the first exact match has it's payload executed.
      # Matched input is passed in to the associated block, or to the controller through #options.
      #
      # Allowed payloads are the name of a controller class, in which case it is executed through its #run method, or a block.
      #
      # #invalid has its associated block executed when the input does not possibly match any pattern.
      # #timeout's block is run when time expires before or between input digits.
      # #failure runs its block when the maximum number of tries is reached without an input match.
      #
      # Execution of the current context resumes after #menu finishes. If you wish to jump to an entirely different controller, use #pass.
      # Menu will return :failed if failure was reached, or :done if a match was executed.
      #
      # @param [Object] A list of outputs to play, as accepted by #play
      # @param [Hash] options Options to use for the menu
      # @option options [Integer] :tries Number of tries allowed before failure
      # @option options [Integer] :timeout Timeout in seconds before the first and between each input digit
      #
      # @return [Symbol] :failure on failure, :done if a match is reached and executed. Will only return if control is not passed.
      #
      # @raise [ArgumentError] Raised if no block is passed in
      #
      # @see play
      # @see pass
