      #
      # Dial a third party and join to this call
      #
      # @param [String|Array<String>|Hash] number represents the extension or "number" that asterisk should dial.
      # Be careful to not just specify a number like 5001, 9095551001
      # You must specify a properly formatted string as Asterisk would expect to use in order to understand
      # whether the call should be dialed using SIP, IAX, or some other means.
      # You can also specify an array of destinations: each will be called with the same options simultaneously.
      # The first call answered is joined, the others are hung up.
      # A hash argument has the dial target as each key, and an hash of options as the value, in the form:
      # dial({'SIP/100' => {:timeout => 3000}, 'SIP/200' => {:timeout => 4000} })
      # The option hash for each target is merged into the global options, overriding them for the single dial.
      # Destinations are dialed simultaneously as with an array.
      #
      # @param [Hash] options
      #
      # +:from+ - the caller id to be used when the call is placed. It is advised you properly adhere to the
      # policy of VoIP termination providers with respect to caller id values.
      #
      # +:for+ - this option can be thought of best as a timeout.  i.e. timeout after :for if no one answers the call
      # For example, dial(%w{SIP/jay-desk-650 SIP/jay-desk-601 SIP/jay-desk-601-2}, :for => 15.seconds, :from => callerid)
      # this call will timeout after 15 seconds if 1 of the 3 extensions being dialed do not pick prior to the 15 second time limit
      #
      # @example Make a call to the PSTN using my SIP provider for VoIP termination
      #   dial "SIP/19095551001@my.sip.voip.terminator.us"
      #
      # @example Make 3 Simulataneous calls to the SIP extensions, try for 15 seconds and use the callerid
      # for this call specified by the variable my_callerid
      #   dial %w{SIP/jay-desk-650 SIP/jay-desk-601 SIP/jay-desk-601-2}, :for => 15.seconds, :from => my_callerid
      #
      # @example Make a call using the IAX provider to the PSTN
      #   dial "IAX2/my.id@voipjet/19095551234", :from => "John Doe <9095551234>"
