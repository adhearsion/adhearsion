      #     You must specify a properly formatted string that your VoIP platform understands.
      #     eg. sip:foo@bar.com, tel:+14044754840, or SIP/foo/1234
      #   @param [Hash] options see below
      #
      # @overload dial(to[Array], options = {})
      #   @param [Array<String>] to Target URIs to dial.
      #     Each will be called with the same options simultaneously.
      #     The first call answered is joined, the others are hung up.
      #   @param [Hash] options see below
      #
      # @overload dial(to[Hash], options = {})
      #   @param [Hash<String => Hash>] to Target URIs to dial, mapped to their per-target options overrides.
      #     Each will be called with the same options simultaneously.
      #     The first call answered is joined, the others are hung up.
      #     Each calls options are deep-merged with the global options hash.
      #   @param [Hash] options see below
      #
      # @option options [String] :from the caller id to be used when the call is placed. It is advised you properly adhere to the
      #   policy of VoIP termination providers with respect to caller id values. Defaults to the caller ID of the dialing call, so for normal bridging scenarios, you do not need to set this.
      #
      # @option options [Numeric] :for this option can be thought of best as a timeout.
      #   i.e. timeout after :for if no one answers the call
      #
      # @option options [CallController] :confirm the controller to execute on the first outbound call to be answered, to give an opportunity to screen the call. The calls will be joined if the outbound call is still active after this controller completes.
      # @option options [Hash] :confirm_metadata Metadata to set on the confirmation controller before executing it. This is shared between all calls if dialing multiple endpoints; if you care about it being mutated, you should provide an immutable value (using eg https://github.com/harukizaemon/hamster).
      #
      # @example Make a call to the PSTN using my SIP provider for VoIP termination
      #   dial "SIP/19095551001@my.sip.voip.terminator.us"
      #
      # @example Make 3 simulataneous calls to the SIP extensions, try for 15 seconds and use the callerid for this call specified by the variable my_callerid
      #   dial %w{SIP/jay-desk-650 SIP/jay-desk-601 SIP/jay-desk-601-2}, :for => 15.seconds, :from => my_callerid
      #
      # @example Make a call using the IAX provider to the PSTN
      #   dial "IAX2/my.id@voipjet/19095551234", :from => "John Doe <9095551234>"
