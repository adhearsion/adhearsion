      # @overload dial(to[String], options = {})
      #   @param [String] to The target URI to dial.
      #     You must specify a properly formatted string that your VoIP platform understands.
      #     eg. sip:foo@bar.com, tel:+14044754840, or SIP/foo/1234
      #   @param [Hash] options see below
      #
      # @overload dial(to[Array], options = {})
      #   @param [Array<String>] to Target URIs to dial.
      #     Each will be called with the same options simultaneously.
      #     The first call answered is joined, the others are hung up.
      #   @param [Hash] options see below
      #
      # @overload dial(to[Hash], options = {})
      #   @param [Hash<String => Hash>] to Target URIs to dial, mapped to their per-target options overrides.
      #     Each will be called with the same options simultaneously.
      #     The first call answered is joined, the others are hung up.
      #     Each calls options are deep-merged with the global options hash.
      #   @param [Hash] options see below
      #
      # @option options [String] :from the caller id to be used when the call is placed. It is advised you properly adhere to the
      #   policy of VoIP termination providers with respect to caller id values. Defaults to the caller ID of the dialing call, so for normal bridging scenarios, you do not need to set this.
      #
      # @option options [Numeric] :for this option can be thought of best as a timeout.
      #   i.e. timeout after :for if no one answers the call
      #
      # @option options [CallController] :confirm Confirmation controller to execute. Confirmation will be attempted on all answered calls, and calls will be allowed to progress through confirmation in parallel. The first to complete confirmation will be joined to the A-leg, with the others being hung up.
      # @option options [Hash] :confirm_metadata Metadata to set on the confirmation controller before executing it. This is shared between all calls if dialing multiple endpoints; if you care about it being mutated, you should provide an immutable value (using eg https://github.com/harukizaemon/hamster).
      #
      # @option options [CallController] :apology controller to execute on calls which lose the race to complete confirmation before they are hung up
      #
      # @option options [CallController] :cleanup The controller to execute on each call being cleaned up. This can be used, for instance, to notify that the call is being terminated. Calls are terminated right after this controller completes execution. If this is not specified, calls are silently terminated during cleanup.
      # @option options [Hash] :cleanup_metadata Metadata to set on the cleanup controller before executing it. Defaults to :confirm_metadata if not specified.
      #
      # @option options [Hash] :join_options Options to specify the kind of join operation to perform. See `Call#join` for details.
      # @option options [Call, String, Hash] :join_target the target to join to. May be a Call object, a call ID (String, Hash) or a mixer name (Hash). See `Call#join` for details.
      #
      # @option options [#call] :pre_join A callback to be executed immediately prior to answering and joining a successful call. Is called with a single parameter which is the outbound call being joined.
      #
      # @option options [Array, #call] :ringback A collection of audio (see #play for acceptable values) to render as a replacement for ringback. If a callback is passed, it will be used to start ringback, and must return something that responds to #stop! to stop it.
      #
      # @yield [Adhearsion::CallController::Dial::Dial] Provides the newly initialized Dial object to the given block, particularly useful in order to obtain a reference to it for later use.
      #
      # @example Make a call to the PSTN using my SIP provider for VoIP termination
      #   dial "SIP/19095551001@my.sip.voip.terminator.us"
      #
