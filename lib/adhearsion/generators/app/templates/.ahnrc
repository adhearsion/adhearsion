# Adhearsion Runtime Configuration.

# You can use the "gems" section to force Adhearsion to load a particular version of a gem.
# This is useful when a component require()s a gem, but you don't want it to use the latest one installed on the system.
# For example, if a component require()s activerecord, sucking in the latest on the system, and then you enable a Rails app
# which wants a particular version of activerecord, RubyGems will raise an error saying "you cannot activate two versions of
# the same gem". Note: specifying the version, source and require names is optional, but you must include a : after the gem name to make it a YAML key/value pair (with a nil value).
