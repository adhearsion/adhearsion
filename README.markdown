Adhearsion
===========

Adhearsion is an open-source voice application development framework. Adhearsion users write applications atop the framework with Ruby and **call into their code**.

Adhearsion rests above a lower-level telephony platform, for example [Asterisk](http://asterisk.org) or [Voxeo PRISM](http://voxeolabs.com/prism/), and provides a framework for integrating with various resources, such as SQL, LDAP and XMPP (Jabber).

Features
--------

* An elegant system of call controllers for writing the code which controls a live phone call.
* An events subsystem which maintains a Thread-pool for executing your namespaced callbacks.
* A very useful plugin architecture with which you may write Adhearsion plugins and share them with the world via RubyGems.
* JRuby compatibility for running atop the Java Virtual Machine and using virtually any Java library.
* Ability to re-use existing Ruby on Rails database models with ActiveRecord/ActiveLDAP
* Easy interactive communication via XMPP instant messages using the Blather library
* Strong test coverage
* Much more

Requirements
------------

* Ruby 1.9.2+ or JRuby 1.6.7+
* A VoIP platform:
  * Asterisk 1.8+
  * Prism 11+ with rayo-server
* An interest in building cool new things

Install
-------

`gem install adhearsion`

Examples
--------

An Adhearsion application can be as simple as this:

```ruby
answer
say 'Hello, and thank you for your call. We will put you through to the front desk now...'
dial 'tel:+18005550199'
hangup
```
