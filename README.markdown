Adhearsion
===========

Adhearsion is an open-source voice application development framework. Adhearsion users write applications atop the framework with Ruby and **call into their code**.

Adhearsion rests above a lower-level telephony platform, namely [Asterisk](http://asterisk.org), and provides a framework for integrating with various resources, such as SQL, LDAP and XMPP (Jabber).

Features
--------

* An elegant dialplan system for writing the code which controls a live phone call
* A sophisticated Asterisk Manager Interface library with a lexer written in [Ragel](http://www.complang.org/ragel).
* An events subsystem which maintains a Thread-pool for executing your namespaced callbacks. (supports AMI events too!)
* A very useful plugin architecture with which you may write Adhearsion plugins and share them with the world via RubyGems.
* JRuby compatibility for running atop the Java Virtual Machine and using virtually any Java library.
* Ability to re-use existing Ruby on Rails database models with ActiveRecord/ActiveLDAP
* Easy interactive communication via XMPP instant messages using the Blather library
* Good regression test coverage

Requirements
------------

* Ruby 1.9.2+ or JRuby 1.6.5+
* A VoIP platform:
  * Asterisk 1.8+
  * Prism 11+ with rayo-server

Install
-------

`gem install adhearsion`

Examples
--------

An Adhearsion application can be as simple as this:

```ruby
answer
speak 'Hello, and thank you for your call. We will put you through to the front desk now...'
dial 'tel:+18005550199'
hangup
```
